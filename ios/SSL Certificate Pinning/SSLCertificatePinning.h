/** This class implements certificate pinning utility functions.
 
 First, the certificates and domains to pin should be loaded using
 loadSSLPinsFromDERCertificates:. This method will store them in
 ""~/Library/SSLPins.plist".
 
 Then, the verifyPinnedCertificateForTrust:andDomain: method can be
 used to validate that the certificate pinned to a specific domain is in
 the server's certificate chain when connecting to it.
 This method should be used in the
 connection:willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge: method of the
 NSURLConnectionDelegate object that is used to perform the connection.
 
 Alternatively, the SSLPinnedNSURLConnectionDelegate class can be
 used instead as the connection delegate.
